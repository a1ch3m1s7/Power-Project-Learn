MIDWAY THROUGH THE JOURNEY OF OUR LIFE,
I FOUND MYSELF WITHIN A SHADOWED WOOD,
FOR THE STRAIGHT PATH HAD VANISHED FROM MY SIGHT.
THE FOREST DARK, TANGLED AND WILD WITH FEAR,
STIRRED IN MY SOUL THE DREAD I CANNOT TELLÂ€”
SO BITTER IT IS, DEATH COULD SCARCELY BE WORSE.
BUT TO REVEAL THE GOOD I FOUND WITHIN,
I MUST RECOUNT THE TERROR I FIRST FACED,
AND HOW I MET THE BEAST THAT BARRED MY WAY,
UNTIL A NOBLE SHADE LENT ME HIS AID.
