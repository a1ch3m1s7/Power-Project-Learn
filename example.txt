Midway through the journey of our life,
I found myself within a shadowed wood,
For the straight path had vanished from my sight.
The forest dark, tangled and wild with fear,
Stirred in my soul the dread I cannot tellâ€”
So bitter it is, death could scarcely be worse.
But to reveal the good I found within,
I must recount the terror I first faced,
And how I met the beast that barred my way,
Until a noble shade lent me his aid.
